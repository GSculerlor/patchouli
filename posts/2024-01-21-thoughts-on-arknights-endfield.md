I got to try out a technical test version of Arknights: Endfield. My first thought was I really impressed with how well it looked, even for a test build. It ran smoothly on my old 1660 Super (which is capped at 60fps anyway). The first cutscene and the ‚Äútutorial‚Äù section where we move around and catch up with the Tower of Babel were really cool. This post is basically a summary of my experience during the technical test. The game server will be close by in about a day, but I can‚Äôt play it anymore because I‚Äôve been AFK.

By the way, I‚Äôm not going to talk about the story. It definitely needs some work because it feels weak right now. I think they‚Äôll improve it in the release version, though. Also, I‚Äôm not going to compare it to other games like Genshin, since I haven‚Äôt played it yet.

<small>By the way, I really love the Triaggeloi boss fight. Unfortunately, there is no way to trigger the boss fight again after completing it.

## combat

Combat experience can be a bit hit or miss for me. One thing I really like is that everyone on the team shows up on the screen at the same time and actually does damage and even takes damage from enemies. This makes me think more about how to set up the strategy and adjust my gameplay and actions based on my team‚Äôs position and actions.

However, the AI for uncontrolled operators could use some improvement. Sometimes they miss their navigation and actions, so I have to spend resources to either heal or resurrect characters that I don‚Äôt control. But I still love bringing four characters on board and seeing them all on the battlefield and contributing in some way. 

Here‚Äôs my thoughts on the game‚Äôs features:

**Attacks:**

I loved the skills and ultimate abilities of each character, but the basic attacks left me a bit underwhelmed. They feel weak and lack the punch I was expecting. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm just waiting for my skill charge to recharge before I can actually do anything. I think the basic attack needs some serious improvement, maybe by increasing the damage or completely revamping the system to make it more reliable. We don‚Äôt want to be just activating skills and running away.

**Skills and Ultimates:**

I really enjoyed using the skills and ultimates. It‚Äôs so satisfying to think about the skill activation sequence and how to maximize the damage and effects on the enemies. My only gripe is that sometimes, if I switch to a different skill after casting one, I lose the previous skill‚Äôs effect. That doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me.

**Skill Casting:**

Overall, the skill casting system is pretty good (except for Fjall. Dude, your skill cast area is way too small lmao).

**Dealing Effects:**

Dealing effects to the enemies is also pretty satisfying. It‚Äôs like playing a game of tug-of-war with the enemies. Pretty much the same with Arknights, you can inflict effects like knockback, lifting, and knockback. I don‚Äôt really care about dodge, to be honest. It‚Äôs just something that makes the game easier to control, but with my current control setup, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessary. Maybe dodging for uncontrolled characters is a good idea, though.

**Orb Mechanics:**

I don‚Äôt really care about this part of the game. Orbs spawn randomly, and only some skills can deal fusions and chaining, so I don‚Äôt really rely on these mechanics. In the end, I just spam my skills and let the orbs fusions happen whenever they do. 

Last but not least, I‚Äôd love to see some control improvements. As a 60% keyboard user, switching between characters can be a real pain. Since you can‚Äôt bind it to other keys, I have a few options: press the Fn key every time I want to change characters, only change characters when their skill is active, or use the mouse button and remap it to F1 to F4 keys. But honestly, it‚Äôs so frustrating not to have the option to rebind those keymaps.

Another small suggestion: I think it would be great if you could add more item slots. Right now, I think 3 is enough since you probably need to bring 1 healing item, 1 buff item, and 1 resurrection item. But having more slots for healing or buff items would be really appreciated. 

## Enemies

I‚Äôve got a few thoughts on the enemy design in the game. I‚Äôm a bit partial to the enemy design, but I‚Äôd love to see more variety in monsters and mini-bosses across the maps. It would be awesome if there was always something new to discover. Boss fights are definitely fun, and the crisis stages are also challenging and enjoyable. I wish boss fights were more replayable (maybe include them on rifts or something that would be cool).

![giga4head](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-21%20235011.png)

However, I‚Äôm a bit disappointed that the enemy level doesn‚Äôt scale up on the previous map. It makes enemies easy to deal with (just one hit and they‚Äôre gone). I wish they also scaled up based on our operator‚Äôs level or other indicators (I imagine it like mobs on Nier:Automata).

![hub base enemy](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-21%20235225.png)

For example, in the Hub Base, killing level 6 aggeloi using a max-level operator is just a mouse click away. I really wish enemies here also scaled up based on our progress.

I also like the buffed enemies concept on Crisis rifts. Something that I‚Äôm really looking forward to seeing again! 

## Characters and animations

The characters and animations are amazing! Coming from Arknights, where everything is 2D, it‚Äôs refreshing to see how they‚Äôll look in 3D. The animations are also top-notch. I could spend hours just switching between characters and menus on the character page. It‚Äôs so smooth and responsive. Each character has unique animations for every menu and position on the team, and the attention to detail is incredible. The cutscenes are also worth watching. My favorite is definitely the pre-Triagelloi boss fight and the post-Triagelloi boss fight. I won‚Äôt go into much detail about the voice acting and grammar since I‚Äôm not really into that right now. But one thing I noticed is that the characters‚Äô facial expressions during the story narration could be more expressive. I hope they‚Äôll improve that in future updates. 

![triaggeloi cutscene](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-21%20223859.png)

## Weapon system

The weapon‚Äôs essence system is a bit odd. It feels clunky and random at times. You have so much dropped essence that it‚Äôs time-consuming to find the perfect one for the weapon by looking at them all individually. The upgrade mechanism is just repetitive grind gameplay that gets boring after a while. At least they give some resource refunds if you exceed the max cap when leveling your weapon.

In the end, I don‚Äôt really care about this system. I just pick the best weapon for the operators, upgrade and tune it until it‚Äôs at max level, and then I put a random essence that looks good to me. I hope they can improve this system in the future because I still think it has potential.

Oh, and I really hope I don‚Äôt have to gacha to get the weapon when it‚Äôs released, but I guess that‚Äôs never going to happen üòÖ.

The weapons themselves look pretty good, though. The design is cool, even though the names are a bit weird and the details are too generic at the moment.

![technical test exchange](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-21%20114628.png)

![weapons](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-21%20113345.png)

## Rifts

I‚Äôm having a hard time putting my finger on it, but rifts just don‚Äôt feel right. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre stuck in a never-ending dungeon loop, just dropping items for leveling and upgrading. There‚Äôs no connection to the lore or story, no connection to the world itself. It‚Äôs just a random dungeon map for grinding. I hope they give it some kind of reason for being on Talos. Some people suggest auto-running rifts, but I don‚Äôt think that makes them any more fun.

That being said, I still like Crisis and Unstable rifts. Unstable‚Äôs puzzle is really fun and a great way to introduce the game mechanics deeper. And Crisis pushes you to do the combat, but harder and harder than the boss fight. I love it because it kind of reminds me of Arknights‚Äôs Contingency Contract game mode. I really enjoy pushing myself to do something more challenging.

## Missions

The main missions are pretty good since they fit the story. The side missions are okay, but sometimes it‚Äôs hard to figure out who gives you a mission. You basically have to talk to them one by one and hope they give you one (this is where I got the mission that unlocks farms by randomly talking to them). There should be an indicator or at least a hint that lets the player know they want to start a mission, not because they randomly meet an NPC and interact with them.

The daily missions are too repetitive and boring. Most of it you need to walk to meet the NPC, listen to them, and then they ask you to walk again hundreds of meters just to fight mobs that can be killed in seconds. It‚Äôs just not worth the effort. Or you need to find 3 items scattered across the map, which is also boring. I really wish the daily missions were scaled up based on our progress and/or our operator level.

## User interface

The user interface is‚Ä¶wow, it‚Äôs amazing! It‚Äôs futuristic yet still feels like Arknights. I feel right at home with the icons and menus. It‚Äôs like they took Arknights‚Äôs UI and gave it a futuristic makeover. Check out the announcement and news screen - it‚Äôs straight out of Arknights!

![announcement screen](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-21%20110816.png)

The pause menu dial screen is something else. I love it! The profile section might look a bit off, but overall it‚Äôs fantastic. I‚Äôm not a big fan of the gyroscope effect here, but it‚Äôs actually a nice addition to make the screen less static and boring.

![pause screen](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-21%20224428.png)

My favorite part might be the operator and team screen. I saw the leaks a couple of months ago, and now it‚Äôs even better. It‚Äôs not lifeless anymore and looks really cool. But I still don‚Äôt understand why the second operator has more ‚Äúspotlight‚Äù compared to the first operator on the team screen. Overall, they did a great job designing the UI that‚Äôs simple yet modern for this game. I love it!

![team screen](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-21%20121051.png)

## World exploration and map

I‚Äôve had a lot of time to explore the map and look for cool stuff or collectibles (even though I didn‚Äôt collect all of them). Here‚Äôs a quick recap of my journey. The overall map tone is a bit dull, though it looks perfect for the game and the story. It could use more diversity, though. Some maps have weird or unintuitive world borders that make exploring feel a bit restricted. And the biggest issue is that each map feels disconnected from the others. It‚Äôs unique and easy to tell the difference, but it‚Äôs too distinct, making it feel a bit disjointed.  

![overall map](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-20%20111325.png)

### Hub Base

![hub base map](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-20%20217215.png)

The hub base is really nice to explore, even though it feels so huge and empty right now. Since you‚Äôll probably spend most of your time here, it‚Äôs good that it‚Äôs big enough to explore. I love the idea of combining modern tech buildings with wilderness into a single explorable map. It makes the map more engaging and encourages you to explore every spot. The hub base doesn‚Äôt have a lot of complexity, and the vertical layout makes it easy to explore and navigate. 

![hub base 1](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-20%20217334.png)

![hub base 2](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-20%20217862.png)

oh also, the Lone Trail easter egg is cool (maybe I'm biased because I love Blues with You), but still nice addition. 

super cool!

### Valley Pass

![valley pass overall](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-20%20218215.png)

The map‚Äôs vibe is pretty cool. The mix of broken buildings and infrastructure with wilderness and originium shards is really interesting. But I didn‚Äôt explore it much because there‚Äôs not much to do here. I hope they add more content to the map, except for the boss fight and a super boring daily mission. 

![valley pass 1](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-20%20218453.png)

![valley pass 2](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-20%20218614.png)

### Quarry

![quarry overall](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-20%20221314.png)

So, this map introduces the concept of exploring vertically, but it‚Äôs got a few flaws. The overall design is a bit plain, just a big structure with some stone-mining site. The marker doesn‚Äôt show you what level your destination is, except for a faint yellow glow. And wiring electricity here is a real pain in the neck. I‚Äôve had some close calls where I fell off the cliff and had to redo the wiring multiple times. Plus, almost every corner of the map looks the same, which can be a bit disorienting.

![quarry 1](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-20%20221457.png)

![quarry 2](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-20%20221525.png)

### Originium Research Park

![originium research park overall](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-20%20222129.png)

The map is pretty complex, which makes it challenging to explore. But overall, I sort of like it. The broken laboratory with all those originium shards and blights adds a lot of diversity to the map. The lack of verticality makes it easier to navigate, which is a plus. And the ziplines are a great way to cross the huge gap, giving you some awesome views along the way. The indoor map structure is pretty intricate, but it‚Äôs still easy to find your way around. The indoor (and explosive site) props feel different from the hub base, which gives the map a more retro vibe. And there‚Äôs some lore-related stuff on the hub base that you can explore in the future. The farm here is also useful for gathering rare materials, but I wish they made it more obvious instead of giving some side quest that people can easily skip or miss. 

![originium research park 1](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-20%20222713.png)

![originium research park 2](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-20%20222410.png)

### Blight Zone

![blight zone overall](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-20%20224501.png)

This map is my least favorite so far. It‚Äôs super complex with lots of verticality, and the zones are really far apart. The mobs are also tough to clear, especially at first. Navigating here is a pain in the neck. You can easily fall off the platform and it‚Äôs hard to get back to where you started. Oh, and don‚Äôt even get me started on the blight-covered bridges! They‚Äôre so annoying to cross.

The map is definitely blight-heavy, just like its name. There are pink stones everywhere, some of which are covered in blight. There are also huge fossils, abandoned posts, and vehicles scattered around. It gives you a really bad feeling. But unlike the other maps, I find it really boring to explore. It feels so monotonous. And exploring the edge of the map is just not worth it. The reward is just not worth the effort. I really wish this map had been a bit more interesting.

In terms of scenery, I think this map has the best scenery of any other map.

![blight zone 1](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-20%20224680.png)

![blight zone 2](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-20%20224842.png)

## AIC

A quick disclaimer: I don‚Äôt really spend a lot of time building my base because I‚Äôm a bit of a perfectionist. If I got stuck in this game, I might just end up not playing it and just spend all my time arranging my base. But I still spend a good amount of time working on my base, especially unlocking the tech tree and getting the items I need to progress.

I love the overall design and theme of the buildings. It gives you a modern tech vibe and it works perfectly for all of the buildings. Modern tech-thingy buildings surrounded by wilderness also give you the feeling that you‚Äôre building a base in the middle of nowhere. The UIs to interact with the buildings are also good, again, giving you a modern tech vibe. 

![base UI 1](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-21%20440811.png)

![base UI 2](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-21%20451762.png)

The tech tree and base expansion are great additions that make base building more engaging. When you feel like your base is in tip-top shape, you unlock new buildings or your base gets bigger, giving you new things to play with. The tech tree also keeps some game mechanics like breaking walls locked until late game, which I think is still a good ‚Äúsoft lock‚Äù mechanism, even though it feels a bit late. Since this is called ‚Äúbasic AIC plan,‚Äù I assume there will be more advanced AIC buildings and items in the future.

![tech tree](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-16%20140811.png)

Moving stuff around is a bit rough, though. First, every time you move the electric pylon, your electricity is disconnected. It‚Äôs pretty realistic, but it‚Äôs still a bit annoying to rewire everything every time you move stuff or maybe you do some base rebuilding after unlocking the new stuff. Second, your characters also move along when you move your building, which sometimes makes it harder to do it. For example, you want to move your building by one grid behind, but your character can‚Äôt move there because they‚Äôre blocked by the building you want to move, so you have to move it way further first and then bring it back to your original target area. It‚Äôs a real pain in the neck and I hope it‚Äôll be fixed or improved in the future.

![moving issue](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-20%20223409.png)

The third one is placing the belt sometimes misses and makes you reroute a bunch of belts that are affected. Maybe it‚Äôs because I wasn‚Äôt careful enough when placing it, but it was still a weird experience regardless.

The last one is when you build or move something around the border of your map and then your character moves out of the border, your progress is canceled immediately. It shouldn‚Äôt let you out of the base in the first place when you do some action related to the base or the building.

After completing the boss fight and other activities, I spent some time in the base, arranging things. However, it‚Äôs quite limited, with only the building and arranging options. I believe it would be great if there was a PvE mechanism that allows enemies to attack the base, providing an additional activity that engages the player beyond building. This could be similar to Fallout 76 or Reclamation Algorithm.

Overall, I really enjoy the AIC and base-building gameplay. Since the technical test was short and I didn‚Äôt want to waste my time here (and risk getting reset after the test), I didn‚Äôt put in much effort. Nevertheless, I‚Äôve included some images of my very cluttered base (efficiency at its peak).

![base](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-21%20652721.png)

![base](/assets/2024-01-21-thoughts-on-arknights-endfield/Screenshot%202024-01-21%20662590.png)

I wish there was a cinematic option here where you could take pictures of the scenery or backgrounds without showing the UIs for aesthetic purposes. 

## Closing

This game has a lot of potential, even for a technical test build. The combat and AIC/base-building gameplay are already pretty cool, and the UI looks polished and easy to understand. The combats could use some work, but they‚Äôre doing great so far. The story is a bit rough and boring, but I hope it improves in the future.

AIC/base building offers some really engaging game loops that can keep players hooked for hours, but it might not be for everyone. It‚Äôs great that you can beat the game without really caring about this gameplay, though.

Overall, it‚Äôs still a bit boring and not super exciting. There‚Äôs not a lot of content or things to do except base building. And if you‚Äôve already done the main story, you‚Äôre stuck with some boring side missions or daily missions. Exploring maps for collectibles is not really my thing, and grinding rifts for materials is just so repetitive and boring. It‚Äôs especially bad when you have a pretty stacked team and can clear it without thinking. This game needs more content that can keep players engaged without needing to grind rifts or aimlessly explore the map.

I‚Äôm not sure if this game is suitable for mobile. Sure, PC and console seem like good options, but for mobile, judging by the gameplay itself, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ready yet (like, how do you even control your team when fighting Triaggeloi using a mobile phone?). I‚Äôm not sure what the mobile release will look like, but I hope it has the same content as the PC/console version.

But in the end, I had a good time playing the technical test and I‚Äôm excited to see the release version of the game!

This map introduces the concept of exploring vertically (well, exploration in general basically), but it has a few flaws. The overall design is a bit plain, just a big structure with some stone-mining sites. The marker doesn‚Äôt show you what level your destination is, except for a faint yellow glow. And wiring electricity here is a real pain in the neck. I‚Äôve had some close calls where I fell off the cliff and had to redo the wiring multiple times. Plus, almost every corner of the map looks the same, which can be a bit disorienting.

## Extras

I‚Äôll attach a bunch of screenshots and videos here. You can compare them with the release version and see the changes.
